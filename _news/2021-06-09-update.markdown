There are 2 sections of the route which need to be avoided:

The CA Department of Fish and Wildlife (I believe?) shut down a short section of the trail between Pamo Rd and SR78 (around mile 32 on the BFL). This means the entire 4.5 mile section has to be bypassed by continuing south on Pamo Rd, to West Haverdford Rd onto SR78 heading west to rejoin the route. This highway can carry a lot of traffic at times, so be cautious.

There have been reports that the old Banner Toll Road heading up into Julian (around mile 120 on BFL) is overgrown and torn up, for now stick to the asphalt up Banner Grade then use Wynola & Farmer Rd into Julian.
