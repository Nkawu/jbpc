This year's group start date will be on Friday October 19, 2018 at 8AM to make use of the full moon! All loops start in 
Julian, but if you're doing the Beach Loop or BFL, you can start at Torrey Pines State Beach or at Lake Hodges in Escondido. 
Join the Facebook page if you haven't yet for more info.
