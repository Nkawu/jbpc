We have made 2 changes to the beach loop (and BFL) to bypass the private property in Poway (Stagecoach Rd) as a recent rider got turned around by the property owner. The other change, also in Poway removes a very steep hike-a-bike section and provides easier access to resupply at a 7-Eleven. GPX files have been updated, cue sheets will be updated later.
